# LibraryBookApp

I used HTML, Bootstrap, and Javascript to customize this app. I used a single checkbox for yes/no instead of two.


e.stopImmediatePropagation(); I added this to prevent the Delete message from being displayed twice. I found this by doing an internet search to solve this duplicate problem. This method prevents other listeners of the same event from being called.
